# defi-user-behavior-clustering

> /!\ Work in progress /!\

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze and cluster user behavior in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms using open-source data. By examining user interactions, transaction patterns, and other relevant metrics, the goal is to uncover meaningful insights into how users engage with DeFi applications. These insights can help to improve platform designs, identify emerging trends, and provide valuable information for both developers and users within the DeFi ecosystem.
